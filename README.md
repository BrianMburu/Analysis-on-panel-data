## Panel Data Analysis

This Jupyter notebook contains a comprehensive analysis of panel data. The dataset used in this notebook is processed to fit a pooled model, which is then tested for homoskedasticity and non-autocorrelation. White-test and Breusch-Pagan-test are used to confirm heteroskedasticity. Moreover, fixed and random effects models are also fitted and their performances are tested. This notebook is designed to provide a detailed understanding of panel data analysis and the practical implementation of various econometric techniques.
